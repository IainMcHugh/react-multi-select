# React multi select

This is a demo app to demonstrate how generic state management modules can be utilised to offer ultamite flexibilty from a data usage side, while simultaneously keeping the UI entirely seperated from app state.

The entire state management module is located in [src/modules/MultiSelect](https://github.com/IainMcHugh/react-multi-select/tree/master/src/modules/MultiSelect)

It's a basic create-react-app with typescript, to use simply:
```
npm run install
```
and
```
npm run start
```
